## **Acknowledgements**

This project is based on the **AddressBook-Level3 (AB3)** project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

We would like to acknowledge the following sources that have been instrumental in the development of this project:

#### **Code and Ideas**
*   The overall architecture and a significant portion of the codebase were adapted from the original **AddressBook-Level3** project.
*   The implementation pattern for creating new commands (such as `linkClass`, `createClass`, etc.) was heavily guided by the official [**AB3 Tutorial**](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html).
*   The design of the GUI, including the layout and display of person cards, is an adaptation of the JavaFX structure provided by the AB3 project.

#### **Third-Party Libraries**
*   **[JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/)**: Used for the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
*   **[Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)**: Used for handling the serialization and deserialization of data to and from JSON format.
*   **[JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/)**: Used for writing the extensive suite of unit and integration tests.
*   **[Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle)**: Used for maintaining a consistent and high-quality coding style across the project.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Link classes to a tutee/tutor: `linkClass` feature

Links an existing Student or Tutor to an existing TuitionClass identified by day and timeslot, enforcing one-class-per-student and one-tutor-per-class constraints while updating both the class roster and the person record.

#### Implementation

The `linkClass` mechanism is facilitated by the `LinkClassCommand`, its parser, and model helper methods. It integrates with the `Model` via the following operations:

- `Model#findTuitionClass(ClassId)` â€” Locates a class by `d/DAY` and `ti/TIME`.
- `Model#findPersonByName(Name)` â€” Locates the target person by exact name.
- `TuitionClass#setTutorId(PersonId)` / `removeTutorId()` â€” Assigns or clears the class tutor.
- `TuitionClass#addStudentId(PersonId)` â€” Records a student in the class roster.
- `Student#setTuitionClass(TuitionClass)` â€” Records the studentâ€™s enrolled class.
- `Model#setTuitionClass(TuitionClass, TuitionClass)` and `Model#setPerson(Person, Person)` â€” Persist changes and trigger UI refresh.

---

#### Usage Scenario

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `linkClass` mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application. The `Model` is initialized with persons and classes.

**Step 2.** The user executes `linkClass d/Monday ti/H14 n/John Doe`. The parser validates required prefixes and constructs a `LinkClassCommand` with the timeslot (ClassId) and name.

**Step 3.** The command calls `Model#findTuitionClass(classId)`. If no class exists at that timeslot (no class has the ClassId), an error is returned and the state is unchanged.

**Step 4.** The command calls `Model#findPersonByName(name)`. If no matching person exists, an error is returned and the state is unchanged.

**Step 5.** If the person is a `Student`:
- If the student is already linked to a class, an error is returned and the state is unchanged.
- Otherwise, the studentâ€™s `classId` is set and the classâ€™s `studentIds` is updated. The command then calls `Model#setTuitionClass(...)` and `Model#setPerson(...)` to persist and refresh the UI.

**Step 6.** If the person is a `Tutor`:
- If the class already has the same tutor, an error is returned. If it has a different tutor, an error instructs to unlink before reassigning.
- Otherwise, the classâ€™s `tutorId` is set. The command then calls `Model#setTuitionClass(...)` and `Model#setPerson(...)` to persist and refresh the UI.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution (e.g. class/person not found, student already linked, tutor already teaching, class already has a different tutor), no call to `Model#setTuitionClass(...)` or `Model#setPerson(...)` is made, so no state is changed.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how `linkClass` flows through the `Logic` and `Model` components:

**Note**: For readability, the sequence diagram omits early-return error branches (e.g. class/person not found, student already linked, tutor already teaching, class already has a different tutor) and the lookup of the current tutor's name via `Model#findPersonById`. These paths are covered in the Detailed Behaviour below.

![LinkClassSequenceDiagram](images/LinkClassSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

#### Detailed Behaviour

- **Input contract**
  - Required prefixes: `d/`, `ti/`, `n/` with non-empty values and no duplicates.
  - Preamble must be empty; otherwise a format error is returned.

- **Lookup and validation**
  - `Model#findTuitionClass(ClassId)` must return a class, else: "The class at the specified timeslot does not exist."
  - `Model#findPersonByName(Name)` must return a person, else: a person-not-found message is shown.
  - If the person is neither `Student` nor `Tutor`, the command fails with: "The person provided is not a student or a tutor."

- **Student path**
  - If `student.getClassId().isPresent()`, the command fails with: "The student is already linked to a class."
  - Otherwise: `student.setTuitionClass(tuitionClass)` and `tuitionClass.addStudentId(student.getId())`.
  - Persist and refresh UI with `Model#setTuitionClass(...)` and `Model#setPerson(...)`.
  - Success message: "Linked Student <name> to Class on <day>, <time>".

- **Tutor path**
  - If `tuitionClass.getTutorId()` is present and equals `tutor.getId()`, fail with: "The tutor is already assigned to this class."
  - If `tuitionClass.getTutorId()` is present but different, fail with: "This class is already assigned to Tutor <currentTutor>. Unlink before reassigning."
  - Otherwise: `tuitionClass.setTutorId(tutor.getId())`.
  - Persist and refresh UI with `Model#setTuitionClass(...)` and `Model#setPerson(...)`.
  - Success message: "Assigned Tutor <name> to Class on <day>, <time>".

- **State updates and UI**
  - Calls to `Model#setTuitionClass` and `Model#setPerson` update observable lists, ensuring the UI reflects the new links immediately.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product Scope

**Target user profile**: The target user is a **tech-savvy GP (General Paper) tuition receptionist**. More broadly,
this includes tech-savvy tuition teachers and receptionists who need to manage a significant number of contacts
across various groups and schedules. The ideal user:
* Can type fast.
* Prefers typing and using a CLI over mouse interactions.
* Prefers desktop applications for management tasks.

**Value proposition**: Helps a tuition centre manager keep track of students, their personal details (like family
contacts), their classes, and schedules. The app allows for quick management of contact details and classes for a
number of JC-level tutees and their tutors, enabling users to manage contacts faster than with a typical
mouse/GUI-driven app. It will not manage other details such as grades and tuition fees.

## **Appendix: Effort**
TutorFlow evolved from the AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) codebase. While AB3 supports only one entity type (`Person`), TutorFlow introduces and manages three person-based entity types (`Student`, `Tutor`, and `Parent`) as well as a non-person entity (`TuitionClass`). Extending AB3 into a multi-entity, relationship-aware system required major redesigns to its model, command logic, storage, and tests.

### Key Challenges and Effort

|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multi-Entity Data Model and Relationships**  | Refactored `Person` into `Student`, `Tutor`, and `Parent` subclasses, and added a new `TuitionClass` entity to represent lessons and linked relationships.                   | ~25% (Reused `Person` base structure and `UniquePersonList` as foundation)           | Cross-layer refactoring, ensuring data consistency, and extensive testing for linked entities.              |
| **Relationship and Class Management Commands** | Added new relational commands (`linkParent`, `getParent`, `createClass`, `linkClass`, `unlinkClass`, `getClassDetails`, `getStudents`) to manage links and class scheduling. | ~20% (Reused AB3â€™s `Command` hierarchy, `LogicManager`, and parser framework)        | Designing linkage logic, handling  edits/deletions of entities, and debugging interdependent relationships. |
| **Persistence and Storage**                    | Extended JSON storage to handle subclasses and `TuitionClass`, maintaining compatibility with AB3â€™s format.                                                                  | ~40% (Reused JSON read/write infrastructure and adapted `JsonAdaptedPerson`)         | Managing subclass serialisation, maintaining referential integrity, and preventing data corruption.         |
| **UI Enhancements**                            | Enhanced JavaFX UI to display categories (*student*, *tutor*, *parent*), relationships (linked parents/children), and class timings.                                         | ~60% (Reused AB3â€™s UI layout and `MainWindow`/`CommandBox` components)               | Implementing dynamic data bindings, relational displays, and contextual command feedback.                   |
| **Testing and Integration**                    | Rebuilt tests for all new features and relationships, extended utilities like `CommandTestUtil` for multi-entity support.                                                    | ~10% (Reused testing structure but rewrote test cases for new entities and commands) | Extensive testing, cross-entity validation, and coverage for complex interactions.                          |


### Achievements
* Expanded AB3â€™s single-entity model into a multi-entity, relationship-aware system. 
* Implemented relational and scheduling features (e.g. `linkParent`, `linkClass`) with consistent data handling. 
* Enhanced the UI to visualise categories, relationships, and class timings. 
* Preserved AB3â€™s structure while substantially increasing functionality and technical depth.

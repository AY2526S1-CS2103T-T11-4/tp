**TutorFlow** is a desktop application designed for **tuition centre managers**, particularly those at **General Paper (GP) tuition centres**. It provides an efficient solution for managing contact details for **JC-level tutees, their tutors, and their parents**, streamlining class scheduling, class tracking, and general stakeholder oversight.

* If you are interested in using TutorFlow, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TutorFlow, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.

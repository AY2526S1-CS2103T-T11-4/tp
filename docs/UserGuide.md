   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add c/student n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to the address book.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: How to read command formats**<br>

*  `UPPER_CASE`: Placeholders that you replace with your own information. <br>
  Example: In `n/NAME`, you replace `NAME` with the actual name: `n/John Doe`.

* `[square_brackets]`: Optional parts of a command. You can leave them out if you don't need them.<br>
  Example: `getClasses [n/TUTOR_NAME]` can be `getClasses n/Eric Hanson` or just `getClasses`.

* `*` (asterisk): Case-insensitive inputs. <br>
  Example: `list [c/*CATEGORY]` can be `list c/tutor`, `list c/STUDENT`, or `list c/Parent`. 

* `...`(ellipsis): Multiple inputs are accepted. <br>
  Example: `find *KEYWORD...` can be `find alex` or `find alex bryan david`

* Extra text for commands that don't take inputs (like `help`, `exit`, `clear`) will be ignored. <br>
  Example: `help 123` is treated as `help`.

### <u>Class Management</u>

#### Creating a class: `createClass`

Creates a new class in the system. Create this first before linking a tutor and students to it.

Format: `createClass d/*DAY ti/*TIME`

* `DAY` must be a valid day of the week (e.g. Monday, TUESDAY, wednesday). 
* `TIME` must be a supported timeslot `H12`, `H14`, `H16`, `H18`, `H20`, which represents `12:00PM`, `2:00PM`, `4:00PM`, `6:00PM`, `8:00PM` respectively.
* The class is created without linked persons. Link a tutor or student using [`linkClass`](#linking-a-person-to-a-class-linkclass).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Each timeslot (combination of a day and a time) is unique. You cannot create a class for a timeslot that already exists.
</div>

Examples:
* `createClass d/MONDAY ti/H16` creates a class on Monday at 4:00 PM.
* `createClass d/tuesday ti/h12` creates a class on Tuesday at 12:00 PM.

• [Back to Command Summary](#command-summary)

<div class="print-tight"></div>

#### Linking a person to a class: `linkClass`

Links an existing student or tutor to an existing class.

Format: `linkClass d/*DAY ti/*TIME n/NAME`

* `NAME` must **exactly match** a student or a tutor in TutorFlow (case-sensitive). 
* The class identified by `DAY` and `TIME` must already exist (created using [`createClass`](#creating-a-class-createclass)).

The `linkClass` command works differently for students and tutors. Here’s what you need to know:

**Linking a Student to a Class**

Each student can be only be enrolled in one class at a time.

<table class="indent-table">
  <tr>
    <th>Scenario</th>
    <th>Result</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The student is <b>not</b> in any class</td>
    <td><b>Success!</b> The student is added to the class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The student is <b>already</b> in a class</td>
    <td><b>Error.</b> The app will tell you the student is already linked.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Assigning a Tutor to a Class**

Each class can only have one tutor, but a tutor can teach multiple classes.

<table class="indent-table">
  <tr>
    <th>Scenario</th>
    <th>Result</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The class has <b>no tutor</b></td>
    <td><b>Success!</b> The tutor is assigned to the class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The class <b>already has a tutor</b></td>
    <td><b>Error.</b> The app will tell you to use <code>unlinkClass</code> to remove the current tutor first.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The tutor is <b>already teaching</b> that class</td>
    <td><b>Error.</b> The app will tell you the tutor is already assigned.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Examples:
* `linkClass d/MONDAY ti/H16 n/Roy Balakrishnan` links tutor Roy Balakrishnan to the Monday 4:00 PM class.

* `NAME` must **exactly match** a student or tutor currently linked to the class (case-sensitive).

Examples:
* `unlinkClass d/MONDAY ti/H16 n/Roy Balakrishnan` removes tutor Roy Balakrishnan from the Monday 4:00 PM class.

* With `n/TUTOR_NAME`: shows only classes linked to the specified tutor using [`linkClass`](#linking-a-person-to-a-class-linkclass).

   **Mac users:** Follow the guide [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest app file (`.jar`) from [the Releases page](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file into a folder where you want your TutorFlow data to be saved.

4. Open a command window/terminal, go to that folder, and run: `java -jar TutorFlow.jar`<br>
   The app window should appear with sample data so you can try things out.<br>

5. Type a command in the box and press Enter. For example, type **`help`** and press Enter to open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add c/student n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to the address book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: How to read command formats**<br>

*  `UPPER_CASE`: These are placeholders that you replace with your own information. <br>
  For example, in `n/NAME`, you replace `NAME` with the actual name: `n/John Doe`.

* `[square_brackets]`: These indicate optional parts of a command. You can leave them out if you don't need them.<br>
  Example: `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be `n/John Doe t/J1` or just `n/John Doe`.

* `…`(ellipsis): This means you can provide multiple of the preceding item (including zero). <br>
  Example: `[t/TAG]…` can be left out, or used like `t/J1`, or `t/J2 t/Trial lesson `.

* Extra text for commands that don't take inputs (like `help`, `exit`, `clear`) will be ignored. <br>
  Example: `help 123` is treated as `help`.

### Saving the data

TutorFlow data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TutorFlow data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TutorFlow will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause TutorFlow to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Moving your TutorFlow data is simple! All your contacts are stored in a single file. Just follow these steps:<br>

**On your OLD computer:**
1. Go to the folder where you run TutorFlow.
2. You will see a sub-folder named ``data``.
3. Inside the ``data`` folder, find the file named ``addressbook.json``. This file contains all your contacts.
4. Copy this ``addressbook.json`` file to a USB drive or a cloud storage service (like Google Drive or Dropbox).<br>

**On your NEW computer:**
1. Download ``tutorflow.jar`` and place it in a new folder where you want to keep the application.
2. Run TutorFlow **once** to let it create its necessary folders, then close it.
3. You will now see a ``data`` folder in the same location as ``tutorflow.jar``.
4. Copy your saved ``addressbook.json`` file from your USB drive into this new ``data`` folder.
5. Your computer will ask if you want to replace the existing file. Choose **"Replace" or "Yes"**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

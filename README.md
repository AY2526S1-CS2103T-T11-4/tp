# TutorFlow

## Overview

TutorFlow is a desktop application designed for **tuition centre managers**, particularly those at **General Paper (GP) tuition centres**. It provides an efficient solution for managing contact details for **JC-level tutees and their tutors**, streamlining class scheduling, attendance tracking, and general stakeholder oversight.

## Key Features

*   **Add Contacts:** Easily create new entries for students, tutors, or parents, with optional categorization.
*   **Delete Contacts:** Quickly remove existing contact records from the system.
*   **View Contacts:** List all contacts or filter them by category (student, tutor, parent) for focused management.

## About the Project

TutorFlow was developed as a project for Software Engineering students, showcasing good object-oriented programming (OOP) practices and a well-structured codebase. While comprehensive in contact and schedule management, it's important to note that this application currently focuses exclusively on these aspects and does not manage grades or tuition fees

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
